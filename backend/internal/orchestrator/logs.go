// unbuffered io.Pipe a client that stalls while reading stdout blocks the
// demuxer, and stderr lines sit in the Docker socket until stdout catches up.
// Since the log socket writes to the browser under a write deadline, "stalls"
// is a normal occurrence rather than an exotic one, and stderr arriving minutes
// after the fact is worse than no stderr at all. Buffering each stream
// independently means a slow consumer only applies back-pressure once its own

// LogStreamer is a demultiplexed view of one container's log output.

// source of garbled output, so it is deliberately not an option; the frames are
// read with stdcopy instead.
//
// A LogStreamer owns two goroutines, one per source. Close stops them and
// releases both Docker connections, so callers must Close — otherwise every
// browser tab that opens and closes the log panel leaks two live ContainerLogs
// streams and two parked goroutines.

// StreamContainerLogs opens a following stdout+stderr stream for a container and
// returns it already demultiplexed. ctx bounds the Docker request itself;
// closing the returned stream is the caller's job.
//
// This opens one connection per fd with a different tail policy on each, which is
// not the obvious way to write it, so the reasoning is worth stating. Docker's
// tail option is applied by the daemon to the *combined* log, before the result
// is filtered down to the requested streams. The combined backfill is ordered
// stderr first and stdout second.
//
// That makes tail a per-stream trap in both directions. Measured against Docker
// v28 on a container that writes 400 stdout lines and 9 stderr lines:
//
//	stdout-only, tail=200  -> the last 200 stdout lines          (correct)
//	stderr-only, tail=200  -> nothing at all                     (wrong)
//	stderr-only, tail=all  -> all 9 stderr lines                (correct)
//
// So stdout, which is the high-volume stream and sits last in the combined
// order, is the one tail can safely cut; stderr sits first, so any tail smaller
// than the whole log discards all of it. The obvious single-connection version
// of this is worse still: tail=200 there returns 200 stdout lines and no stderr,
// which silently hides the one error line a user opened the log panel to find.
//
// The residual cost of tail=all on stderr is an unbounded replay of that stream,
// which is acceptable here for two reasons: stderr is the low-volume stream in
// practice, and the replay is not buffered without limit — the pump writes into
// a bounded pipe, so a container with a huge stderr history applies back-pressure
// and parks the pump rather than growing memory.
